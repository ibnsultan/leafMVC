# Leaf MVC Auth

These are a bunch of controllers to give you an idea on how to handle authentication outside of JWT. Each file has a bunch of comments explaining what's happening on each line.

To create a clean sheet, you can delete the entire entire `Auth` folder and generate a new one with Aloe CLI: `php leaf scaffold:auth --session` or `php leaf scaffold:auth -s`
